Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
<br>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
<br>I but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
<br>remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
<br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
